Title: Regular Language
---

## Definition
A regular language is a type of language that can be defined using regular expressions or recognised by [[Finite Automata]]. Or in other words, regular languages represent a fundamental and well-defined class of languages characterised by their simplicity and regularity.

## Features of Regular Languages
1. **Recognisability by Finite Automata**
   Regular languages can be recognised by finite automata. This includes both Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). These automata serve as abstract computational models that can accept or reject string based on whether the strings conform to the defined pattern of the language.
   
2. **Description via Regular Expressions**
   Regular languages can also be described using regular expressions. Regular expressions are formalisms that consist of symbols and operators (such as concatenation, union, Kleene Star, etc.) used to define patters within strings belonging to the language.
   
3. **Closure Property**
   Regular languages are closed under various operations, meaning that performing operations such as union, concatenation, Kleene star, intersection, and complement on regular languages result in another regular language.
   
4. **Simple patterns**
   Regular languages are capable of representing simple patterns, such as strings that match a specific sequence of symbols, string that contain or do not contain certain substrings, and more.
